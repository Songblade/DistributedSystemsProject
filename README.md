# DistributedSystemsProject
This repository contains the semester-long project for my Introduction to Distributed Systems class, made alone, written in Java. It simulates a scalable fault-tolerant cluster-based system to provide serverless execution of Java code. It uses master-worker architecture, communication with UDP and TCP, and failure detection and failover.
